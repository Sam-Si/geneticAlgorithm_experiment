	- initial state
		+ webgl sample
		+ canon sample

		- merge
			+ cube
			+ trimesh

			- cylinder

	+ playable
		+ camera
		+ raycast demo (keyboard)
		+ checkpoints (circuit)

	- AI

		+ checkpoints (collide/collect)
			+ check if body id is different and valid checkpoint
			+ use it

		+ sensors
			+ setup graphic raycast
			+ chekpoints (walls)
			+ setup physic raycast
			+ show intersection
			+ multiple raycast
				+ get values
			+ collision filters

		+ abstract world (integrate collision groups)
		+ abstract circuit
		+ abstract car
		+ car update sensors (save from-to positions)
		+ raycast sensor (collect sensors values)
		+ reset car (position, brake, etc.)
			+ mannual reset

		- integrate AI
			+ copy past

			+ remove car from main
			+ add simulation
			+ add circuit into simulation
			+ add car into simulation
			+ car guided by ANN
			+ car dying (out of time)
			+ camera
			+ genome by genome? -> seems to work without
				- integrate a one shot
					- quick and dirty
			+ camera
				+ on current best
				+ smooth change of target
			+ made the sensors collide the walls

			+ 2 extra layer of sensors
				+ rigged input
				+ rendering with transparency
				+ true input (updated topology)

			- real level
				- clear legacy car coordinates

			- 3d level
				- checkpoints with walls (normal?)

		- transparent walls
			- modify shader
